# 5-Staged-Pipelined-Processor
It is a simulation of a 5-stage pipelined microprocessor, that can assemble and execute basic assembly code written in miniMIPS instruction set.

It is written in C++ using OOP concepts and takes assembly instructions as input and displays the register and memory values along with total clock cycles taken and final CPI as output.

Sample assembly codes for Fibonacci and Factorial calculation are provided.
