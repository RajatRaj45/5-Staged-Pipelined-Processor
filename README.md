# 5-Staged-Pipelined-Processor
It is a simulation of a 5-stage pipelined microprocessor written in miniMIPS instruction set, that can assemble and execute basic assembly code.

It takes assembly instructions as input and displays the register and memory values along with total clock cycles taken and final CPI as output.

Sample assembly codes for Fibonacci and Factorial calculation are provided.
